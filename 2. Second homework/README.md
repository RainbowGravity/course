# Ansible playbook homework
## About playbooks
I've created two versions of playbooks: 

* __*[This one](dockerized%20playbook)*__ is using docker for app deployment: copying the app files, building the app and Nginx server containers and runs them. 
* __*[And this one](playbook)*__ is installing uWSGI, Nginx and virtualenv for the app, then configuring systemd and runs Nginx server.

All of them support the SSL and the HTTPS on the 443 port. Also using the UFW for port securing and SSH publickeys which you must generate for authentification.

Contanct me if you've found some bugs in the playbooks or the app.

## About app

Very simple service that reading your JSON request in following manner: <br>
```
curl -XPOST -d '{"animal":"cat","sound":"meow","count":3}' -k https://localhost
```
and respond to you with an answer like that:<br>
```
Done! 👌

cat says meow 
cat says meow 
cat says meow 

Made with VS Code by 🌈Gravity
```
But if you failed with texting your JSON data you'll get that answer:
```
❗ Error: Incorrect data request. ❗

Please, enter the correct JSON data.

⭕ Data format: ⭕

{"animal": "value<", "sound": "value", "count": number}
```
## Web version

You can also open it in your browser and send the JSON request. Just put it in the top field, choose a method by toggling the switch and click on the "Send GET/POST" button under. <br><br>

After scrolling down the output field you can see a method that was used.
