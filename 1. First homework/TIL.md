### [Wednesday, 01.09.2021](#first-week)

<p> 
  
1. This is getting to be a tradiditon, <b> Cloud Native DevOps with Kubernetes</b>!
   * <b> ConfigMap objects</b>: learned how to create the ConfigMap and Secret objects and how to import variables from them (you can import variables via env or envFrom or connect them as file), how to update pods after  new ConfigMap data. 
   * <b> Confidetial information</b>: learned about RBAC and passive encrypting of the etcd data.
   ...
<p>
  
2. Learned some Python stuff...
  
 there will be more information tomorrow, feeling very sleepy right now...

### [Tuesday, 31.08.2021](#first-week)

<p> 
  
1. And again, <b> Cloud Native DevOps with Kubernetes</b>:
   * <b> Container security</b>: principle of minimal privileges, why you need not to run processes inside a container as a root, how to ban root-privileged containers and why, how to give containers read-only rights, how to prevent privilege escalation, capabilities of containers and about security contexts and policies;
   * <b> Volumes</b>: learned about emptyDir (they are used by containers for data transfer between them) and Persistent volumes (for data storage), restart policies (you can change from Always to OnFailure) and imagePullSecrets (used for the private registry pulls).
   * <b> Managing pods</b>: more about labels and selectors (not really), about complicated selectors (they are used for advanced sorting), how to bring the pods together on a single node and how to prevent them to do so (hard/soft Affinity/antiAffinity).
   * <b> Pod controllers</b>: DaemonSet objects (DaemonSet are used to create only one replica of the pod on every single node), StatefulSet (used to run the pods in order), Cronjob  and Job-objects (Cronjob are used to run the Job-objects in ordered time, Job-objects are used to complete limited amount of tasks by limited amount of pods)
   * <b> Ingress Resources</b>: learned about the Ingress (load balancer which manages external connections to the services in a cluster), learned a little about Ingress controllers, Isito and Envoy.
</p>

<p>
  
2. Learned more about the Github again, especially about the markdown syntax (URLs, paragraphs, links, tables, etc.)

</p>


### [Monday, 30.08.2021](#first-week)
<p>
  
1. Learned something about Github and created my first repository.

</p>

<p>
  
2. Continued to read and practicing with <b> Cloud Native DevOps with Kubernetes </b> and learned:
   * more kubectl commands, flags and their shortening, kubectx, kubens, how to work with jq and JSON files;
   * about imperative kubectl commands, generation and exporting of YALM files and compairing them;
   * how to work with logs, how to connect to a container, how to use busybox commands inside a container and how to add command shell into containers;
   * about contexts and namespaces and how to interact with them by kubectx and kubens apps.
   * more about containers and pods;
   * more about YALM manifests of a containers, "latest" tag using, checksums of a containers, image pull policies.

</p>

<p>

3. On the first lesson i've learned today:
   * about DevOps engineers and their role in products life cycle;
   * about ways of products development: waterfall, icremetal, iterative, spiral and Agile.
