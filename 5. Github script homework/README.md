# Github open pull requests script
## About
This script is used for Github repository open PRs scanning.
Script is sending requests to the Github api and then parsing the json response from it with jq utility. Script can work with and without OAuth token.

## Requirements
* installed <b>curl</b> utility;
* installed <b>jq</b> utility;
* make sure you have the <b>column</b> utility too (but i don't think that you will run this script on distro that doesn't have it).
* <b>Not a requirement, but an advice</b>: use this script with a Github OAuth token. Every cycle is using from 6 (with repository given) to 8 (with searching by username) requests to Github API because of checks for an errors and users/repos existing. 
## Features 
There are some useful features in this script:
* Script can take and process not only links like ```https://github.com/jackfrued/Python-100-Days```, but you can enter it like ```jackfrued/Python-100-Days``` even with ```/``` at the begginning or at the end of the line or even in both cases at the same time. 
* Script can take and process even only the username! For example, you can enter the ```spring-projects``` and you will get the list of repositories with stars and discriptions.
* The script can take the number of repos displayed per page and the page number. You can skip it and use defaults for repository list and for PRs list by pressing the enter or by using options. 
* In repository PRs section you will be able to see information about most productive contributors and their profile links and open PRs with the titles, lables and links to them too.
* Script can display descriptions of the repositories and titles of the PRs. You need to specify it by options. And you must open your terminal in full screen.
## Options
Script have many options which you can use:
* <b>-p</b> - page number (not amount) for script to scan. Example of use: ```-p10``` for 10th page or ```-pn``` to skip questions about pages during script working and use the default number (1).
Some users may have more than 100 repos as some repositories may have more than 100 PRs. The limit of the Github API to display their amount per page is 100. You can use it to specify the page. <b>By specifying it as option you will apply it to repositories list and open PRs list!</b>
* <b>-s</b> - amount of repositories and open PRs to display per page. Can be used like in the previous example. ```-c10``` for 10 results or ```-cn``` to skip questions and use the default amount (30).
* <b>-t</b> - token option. You can specify or skip token questions and run script without it by using this option. Example: ```-t TOKEN``` to use your token or ```-tn``` to skip token question and run the sctipt without it.
* <b>-r</b> - by this option you can set the link or username to skip questions about it during the script running. Example: ```-r https://github.com/foo/bar``` or ```-r foo/bar``` or ```foo```.
* <b>-a</b> - display titles for pull requests. 
* <b>-b</b> - display descriptions of repositories.
## Examples of use
1. For the first example we will use the [spring-projects/spring-boot](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot) repository. 

```
bash script.sh -r spring-projects/spring-boot -tn -sn -pn
