## Andersen DevOps course repository

Hello!  
In this repository I'll be sharing my progress of learning things about DevOps-engineering (you can check it in my [TIL](1.%20First%20homework/TIL.md)) and uploading finished homework.  
You also can get the list of my completed homeworks from my [telegram bot](https://t.me/RGHomeworkBot).
  
### About me
My name is Ivan Marchenko.  
I'm in love with computer hardware and I'm enthusiast in 
  this direction: building PCs, overclocking and tuning them, 
  creating and programming circuit schemes. I've done all of that. But now I wanna
  go forward and become an IT specialist. To be more accurate,
  I wanna be a DevOps-engineer and learn some new skills and get
  interesting experience.  
 
### There are three reasons why i've chosen this course:

* DevOps. Yeah. That's the main reason.
* Wanna get great experience and knowledge and learn from experienced DevOps engineers. 
* Wanna try my best and start my career in the international outsourcing company.

### And, of course, my expectations from the course:
  
* First expectation is that I'll learn interesting things about DevOps, processes of development and deployment, IT industry. 
* Second is that I'll get knowledge and practical experience of using DevOps tools such as Bash scripting, Kubernetes, Ansible, Github, etc. 
* And last but not least is that I'll level up my English language speaking and writing skills.
